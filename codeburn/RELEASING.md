# Releasing CodeBurn

This document describes the actual steps a maintainer takes to cut CLI, macOS menubar, and Electron desktop releases. CLI releases are run by hand with `npm publish`; macOS menubar releases are automated by `.github/workflows/release-menubar.yml` when a `mac-v*` tag is pushed.

The Electron desktop app (`app/`) is released manually under `desktop-v<version>` tags. Build macOS and Linux artifacts as described in `app/DISTRIBUTION.md`; the tag also runs the read-only `Build Windows installer` workflow on `windows-latest`. Download its `CodeBurn-Windows-Installer` artifact and upload both the `.exe` and `.exe.blockmap` with the other platform assets. The workflow never publishes release assets.

Before announcing a desktop release, the release owner must confirm the live GitHub Release contains all four macOS `.dmg`/`.zip` files, the Linux `.AppImage`, `.deb`, and `.rpm`, and both Windows installer files. Publishing the Release runs the workflow's read-only live-asset verification job. If assets are uploaded after publication, rerun `Build Windows installer` with the `release_tag` input and require that verification job to pass. A failed or missing verification is a release blocker.

## Versioning

CodeBurn uses semantic versioning (major.minor.patch). The CLI and macOS menubar share the same version number for clarity.

## Before Every Release

The authoritative acceptance process lives in [`docs/release-acceptance/README.md`](docs/release-acceptance/README.md). Start a new evidence directory and run the exact candidate through the automated gate:

```bash
node scripts/release-acceptance/run.mjs --mode package --output /absolute/path/to/evidence/run-id
```

For a major release or material parser/cache/UI change, complete every blocking row in `docs/release-acceptance/cases.csv`, append the reviewed result to `docs/release-acceptance/ledger/history.jsonl`, and require installed-artifact click-through on every shipped surface. The automated runner does not replace Desktop, Menu Bar, or browser interaction.

Run the test suite to catch any regressions:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:locks
```

`npm test` covers `tests/`. `npm run test:locks` runs the three parallelism-sensitive
`cache-refresh-lock` suites serially; CI treats them as reporting-only, so check them by
hand here.

Verify that the build completes without errors:

```bash
npm run build
```

## CLI Release Process

### 1. Update the Version

Edit `package.json` to bump the version number. Update both the `version` field at the top and the `package-lock.json` lockfile to match (npm handles this automatically):

```bash
npm version <version>
```

For example, `npm version 0.9.8` updates both files and creates a commit.

Alternatively, edit `package.json` by hand and run `npm install` to regenerate the lockfile with the new version.

### 2. Update the Changelog

Edit `CHANGELOG.md`. Move all changes from the "Unreleased" section into a new section with the version number and today's date:

```markdown
## Unreleased

### ...

## 0.9.8 - 2026-05-10

### Added
- Feature X

### Fixed
- Bug Y
```

Commit these changes:

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: bump to 0.9.8"
```

### 3. Publish to npm

There is no GitHub Actions workflow for the CLI; the maintainer runs `npm publish` from a clean working tree:

```bash
npm publish
```

The `prepublishOnly` script in `package.json` runs `npm run build` first, which bundles the litellm pricing snapshot and then runs `tsup` to emit `dist/cli.js`.

If publishing for the first time on a new machine, run `npm login` first.

### 4. Tag the Release

After npm accepts the publish, tag the commit and push:

```bash
git tag v0.9.8
git push origin v0.9.8
```

The tag is for human reference and to anchor the GitHub Release. No workflow runs on `v*` tags for the CLI today.

### 5. Verify npm Publication

```bash
npm view codeburn version
```

### 5b. Bump the Homebrew Tap

The tap at `getagentseal/homebrew-codeburn` does not update itself — bump it
every CLI release or it drifts (issue #716 sat six versions behind):

```bash
curl -sLO "https://registry.npmjs.org/codeburn/-/codeburn-<version>.tgz"
shasum -a 256 codeburn-<version>.tgz
# edit Formula/codeburn.rb in the tap: url version + sha256, commit, push
```

### 6. Create a GitHub Release

Use the GitHub CLI to create a release with notes from the changelog:

```bash
gh release create v0.9.8 --title v0.9.8 --notes "$(sed -n '/^## 0.9.8/,/^## /p' CHANGELOG.md | head -n -1)"
```

Or use the web interface to draft a release and copy the changelog section into the body.

## macOS Menubar Release Process

The macOS menubar is released separately with its own GitHub Release, but shares the same version number as the CLI.

### 1. Same Version Bump

Follow the same version bumping process as the CLI. Both `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` reflect the shared version.

### 2. Tag the macOS Release

After the CLI tag is published, create a separate tag for the menubar:

```bash
git tag mac-v0.9.8
git push origin mac-v0.9.8
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Builds the Bundle

The `.github/workflows/release-menubar.yml` workflow automatically detects the `mac-v*` tag and:

1. Checks out the repo
2. Runs `mac/Scripts/package-app.sh v0.9.8`
3. Signs the app bundle (ad-hoc signing)
4. Creates a zip file: `CodeBurnMenubar-v0.9.8.zip`
5. Computes a SHA-256 checksum: `CodeBurnMenubar-v0.9.8.zip.sha256`
6. Uploads both to a GitHub Release named "Menubar v0.9.8"

The script output on the build machine shows:

```
✓ Built /path/mac/.build/dist/CodeBurnMenubar-v0.9.8.zip
✓ Checksum /path/mac/.build/dist/CodeBurnMenubar-v0.9.8.zip.sha256
<sha256-hash>  CodeBurnMenubar-v0.9.8.zip
```

No manual action is needed; the workflow handles everything.

### 4. Verify the Release

After the workflow completes, the GitHub Release page shows the zip and sha256 files. The installed CLI command `codeburn menubar --force` fetches the newest `mac-v*` menubar release that includes both assets, verifies the checksum and bundle identity, and installs it into `~/Applications`.

## Homebrew Core

CodeBurn is in homebrew-core. After publishing a new CLI version to npm, the homebrew-core formula is updated automatically by Homebrew's bot or can be bumped manually:

```bash
brew bump-formula-pr codeburn --url "https://registry.npmjs.org/codeburn/-/codeburn-<VERSION>.tgz"
```

Users install with `brew install codeburn` and upgrade with `brew upgrade codeburn`.

## Replacing Assets on an Existing Release

If a release is published with broken assets (e.g., a menubar zip with a build error), re-run the build and upload the fixed assets without creating a new tag.

Use `gh release upload` with the `--clobber` flag to overwrite existing files:

```bash
# After re-running mac/Scripts/package-app.sh v0.9.8 to regenerate the zip and sha256
gh release upload mac-v0.9.8 mac/.build/dist/CodeBurnMenubar-v0.9.8.zip --clobber
gh release upload mac-v0.9.8 mac/.build/dist/CodeBurnMenubar-v0.9.8.zip.sha256 --clobber
```

The GitHub Release page will now serve the fixed assets. The menubar installer selects the newest `mac-v*` release with `CodeBurnMenubar-v*.zip` plus its checksum, so users who run `codeburn menubar --force` after the replacement get the fixed version automatically.

## Rollback

If a released version has a critical bug, the fastest path is to fix the bug and cut a new patch release (e.g., 0.9.8 -> 0.9.9). Delete the broken tag locally and on GitHub if it has not yet been widely distributed:

```bash
git tag -d v0.9.8
git push origin --delete v0.9.8
```

npm does not allow republishing to the same version. If you must unpublish from npm, use `npm unpublish codeburn@0.9.8 --force` (requires Owner role), but this is discouraged and all users who installed that version retain it.

For the menubar, tag a new mac-v0.9.9 and let the workflow build and upload it. Users will see the update pill in the menubar settings and upgrade automatically (or manually via `codeburn menubar --force`).

## Summary

The CLI release is manual: bump the version, update `CHANGELOG.md`, commit, run `npm publish`, then tag and create a GitHub Release. The macOS menubar release is automated: pushing a `mac-v*` tag fires `.github/workflows/release-menubar.yml`, which builds, signs, zips, and publishes the bundle. The Electron desktop release is assembled manually under a `desktop-v*` tag, with the release-authoritative Windows NSIS installer built by the read-only `windows-latest` workflow. The homebrew-core formula is updated automatically or via `brew bump-formula-pr`.
