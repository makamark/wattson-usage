# Cline

Cline VS Code extension and Cline home-data task storage.

Sessions from the Cline **command-line** agent use an unrelated layout and are handled by [Cline CLI](cline-cli.md); this provider does not see them.

- **Source:** `src/providers/cline.ts`
- **Loading:** eager (`src/providers/index.ts:2`)
- **Test:** `tests/providers/cline.test.ts`

## Where it reads from

These task roots are scanned:

1. VS Code extension globalStorage for `saoudrizwan.claude-dev`, in every supported VS Code variant: stable (`Code`), Insiders (`Code - Insiders`), and VSCodium. The per-platform paths come from `getVSCodeGlobalStoragePaths` in `src/providers/vscode-cline-parser.ts`, the same helper Roo Code and KiloCode use.
2. Cline's home-data root at `~/.cline/data`.

Every root is expected to contain a `tasks/` child directory. Discovery is delegated to `discoverClineTasks` in `src/providers/vscode-cline-parser.ts`, so a task is only included when it has a `ui_messages.json` file.

## Storage format

Per-task directories with:

```
tasks/<taskId>/
  ui_messages.json
  api_conversation_history.json
  task_metadata.json
```

`ui_messages.json` provides the `api_req_started` usage entries. `api_conversation_history.json` is used for model extraction. See [`vscode-cline-parser`](vscode-cline-parser.md) for the full schema description.
`task_metadata.json` is part of Cline's task layout but is not read by CodeBurn today.

## Caching

None at the provider level; delegates to the shared helper and normal parser/cache layers.

## Deduplication

Discovery deduplicates by task id across all Cline roots so a task that exists in more than one root (a migration, or the same extension storage seen by two VS Code variants) is not scanned twice. If the same task id exists in multiple roots, the one with the newest `ui_messages.json` wins. Parsing still uses the shared per-call key: `<providerName>:<taskId>:<index>`.

## Quirks

- This provider is intentionally a thin wrapper over the shared Cline-family parser.
- Cline can keep data in both VS Code globalStorage and `~/.cline/data`, depending on version and workflow.
- A user can run Cline in VS Code stable, Insiders, and VSCodium at the same time; each variant has its own globalStorage tree, so all of them must be scanned.
- If Cline changes the JSON shape, fix `vscode-cline-parser.ts` only if Roo Code and KiloCode still pass. Branch provider-specific parsing rather than duplicating the whole parser.

## When fixing a bug here

1. Reproduce with a minimal task directory containing `ui_messages.json` and `api_conversation_history.json`.
2. Run `tests/providers/cline.test.ts`, plus `tests/providers/roo-code.test.ts` and `tests/providers/kilo-code.test.ts` if the shared parser changes.
3. Keep the provider name `cline`; downstream filters and dedup keys depend on it.
