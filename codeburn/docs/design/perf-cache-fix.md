# Spec: fast-path snapshot for `codeburn status --format menubar-json`

## Problem

`codeburn status --format menubar-json` was measured taking 25-90+ seconds per
call, with **no speedup on a repeat call against an unchanged, freshly-warmed
cache**. The initial working hypothesis was a missing mtime/size gate ahead of
per-file content hashing.

Direct re-investigation on the reporter's own machine (live `sample`
profiling of the installed `codeburn status --format menubar-json` binary
against the real ~386MB `session-cache.v7.json`) found:

- The per-source-file change-detection gate hypothesized as missing
  **already exists and is correct**: `reconcileFile`/`fingerprintFile`
  in `src/session-cache.ts` compare `dev/ino/mtimeMs/sizeBytes` and skip
  re-reading/re-hashing any unchanged source transcript. There is no
  content-hashing step anywhere in that gate.
- The actual dominant, reproducible cost on a repeat call is **re-parsing the
  entire monolithic on-disk session cache file itself** (`JSON.parse` of the
  ~386MB blob showed as ~20% of sampled CPU time in isolation) plus **re-running
  the full aggregation pipeline** (`buildMenubarPayloadForRange` in
  `src/usage-aggregator.ts`: day-aggregation, optimize scan, PR/branch
  attribution, model efficiency) over the entire requested period on every
  call.
- Every existing in-memory reuse layer (`parser.ts`'s `sessionCache` Map +
  `CACHE_TTL_MS`, `session-cache.ts`'s `cacheMemo`) is process-local. The
  menubar app spawns a **fresh CLI process per poll**, so none of those layers
  ever pay off for this command — each poll starts cold regardless of how
  recently the identical query was answered.

## Fix

Add a small, disk-persisted **status snapshot** keyed by (a) a cheap,
content-free **corpus fingerprint** and (b) a serialization of the resolved
query.

The corpus fingerprint is a stat-only pass (`discoverAllSessions` +
`fingerprintFile` per discovered source — the exact same `dev/ino/mtimeMs/
sizeBytes` signal `reconcileFile` already uses per source transcript) hashed
into one string, with **no** `session-cache.json` read/parse and no
transcript content read. This is deliberately NOT a fingerprint of the
on-disk `session-cache.v*.json` file itself — that file only gets rewritten
*after* a real parse runs, so gating on its own fingerprint would only ever
change in response to a parse the gate is supposed to be allowed to skip,
permanently masking real source-file changes behind a stale snapshot (caught
by a first implementation attempt's own test: appending new session content
between two identical-query calls did not change the result). Fingerprinting
the discoverable sources directly avoids that trap.

`codeburn status --format menubar-json` computes this fingerprint before
doing any parse/aggregation work; on a fingerprint+query match (or a
still-settling match, see Debounce below) it serves the persisted payload
directly (a handful of `stat()` calls, no `JSON.parse` of the corpus, no
aggregation). On any real mismatch (settled new session activity, or a
different query) it falls through to today's full computation and then
persists the new result for the next poll.

One correctness subtlety caught while implementing this: Claude
`SessionSource.path` (from `discoverAllSessions`) is a **project directory**,
not a leaf transcript file — every other provider's `path` IS the leaf
file/DB it parses. A directory's own mtime only moves when an entry is
added/removed, not when an existing file inside it is rewritten in place, so
fingerprinting Claude sources at the directory level would miss real content
changes to files that already existed at discovery time. `computeCorpusFingerprint`
expands each Claude source to its actual `.jsonl` files first (the same
`collectJsonlFiles` walk `scanProjectDirs` already uses) before fingerprinting.

## Debounce design decision

Per operator direction: once a real corpus change is detected, don't
recompute/re-hash immediately — coalesce a rapidly-churning file (a streaming
assistant turn can touch its transcript many times a second) into one
recompute once things go quiet, rather than paying the full parse+aggregation
cost on every single poll of a burst.

**Existing patterns checked first, as directed**, before inventing a new one:
- `parser.ts`'s `PROGRESS_SAVE_THROTTLE_MS` (5s) throttles partial-cache
  saves during a cold hydration — a *throttle* (rate-limit repeated writes),
  not a settle/debounce (wait for quiet before trusting a value). Different
  problem shape.
- `parser.ts`'s `parseBurstWindowMs()` / `CODEBURN_PARSE_BURST_MS` — the
  closest match in spirit and the one this fix's `statusSnapshotSettleMs()`
  mirrors directly: a small, capped, env-overridable numeric knob computed
  fresh from `process.env` on each call.
- `dashboard.tsx` has a UI-input debounce, but it's a `setTimeout`-based
  interaction debounce scoped to one long-lived TUI process. `codeburn
  status` is a fresh, short-lived CLI process per poll (that's the whole
  reason the in-memory caches don't help it) — a `setTimeout` cannot survive
  across separate process invocations, so a wall-clock **age** check (`Date.now()
  - lastTouchedMs < window`) is the only mechanism that composes with a
  stateless CLI. This is also exactly the idiom `cache-refresh-lock.ts`
  already uses for lock staleness (`age = wallNow() - mtimeMs`), so it's a
  mirror of that pattern, not a new one.

**Where it was NOT put:** the first implementation attempt added the settle
check directly inside `reconcileFile` (deferring an 'appended'/'modified'
verdict on a fresh mtime by returning 'unchanged'). That combination has a
correctness bug: once the outer status-snapshot layer sees a real corpus
fingerprint change, it recomputes via the full pipeline — but if
`reconcileFile` itself defers and reports 'unchanged' for the still-fresh
file, the recompute produces the SAME (stale) result, which then gets
persisted under the NEW corpus fingerprint. Because the outer snapshot only
ever compares fingerprints (not wall-clock time), that stale result would
then be served **forever** for that fingerprint — the settle window would
never get a chance to expire and trigger a real re-read, since nothing
would make the fingerprint change again without a further write. Caught by
this fix's own test before landing. `reconcileFile` was reverted to its
original, unmodified form.

**Where it actually lives:** entirely inside the status-snapshot layer this
fix already introduces, which is the one place with the wall-clock context
needed to expire correctly:
- `computeCorpusFingerprint` now also returns `newestMtimeMs` — the newest
  mtime observed across every discovered source in that pass (0 when there
  are none).
- `session-cache.ts`'s `loadStatusSnapshot(corpusFingerprint, newestMtimeMs,
  queryKey)`: on a fingerprint mismatch (real change detected), if
  `Date.now() - newestMtimeMs < statusSnapshotSettleMs()` it still returns
  the stored (pre-change) payload — deferred, not stale-forever, because the
  caller is told NOT to persist a new snapshot in that case (the old
  baseline survives on disk). The very next poll after writes actually
  stop — once the freshest file's mtime ages past the window — sees the
  same fingerprint mismatch with no grace period left, recomputes for real,
  and persists the settled result. No update is ever masked permanently, it
  is only ever delayed by at most the window.
- **Interval chosen: 2000ms**, env-overridable via
  `CODEBURN_STATUS_SNAPSHOT_SETTLE_MS` (capped at 60_000ms, mirroring
  `CODEBURN_PARSE_BURST_MS`'s cap). Rationale: long enough to coalesce a
  streaming turn's rapid successive appends into one recompute; short enough
  that the menubar's displayed numbers don't visibly lag a user's real
  activity by more than ~2s. This is a tunable UX judgment call, not hard
  science — flagged explicitly for review.

## Scope

- `src/parser.ts`: add `computeCorpusFingerprint(providerFilter?)` — reuses
  the already-imported `discoverAllSessions` and `fingerprintFile`, plus the
  already-defined `collectJsonlFiles` for the Claude directory-expansion
  case above. Returns `{ hash, newestMtimeMs }`.
- `src/session-cache.ts`: add `loadStatusSnapshot(corpusFingerprint,
  newestMtimeMs, queryKey)` / `saveStatusSnapshot(corpusFingerprint,
  newestMtimeMs, queryKey, payload)` and the `statusSnapshotSettleMs()` knob
  (one `status-snapshot.<queryKeyHash>.json` file per distinct query in the
  cache dir — so concurrent callers with different queryKeys never evict
  each other — atomic temp+rename write with a CAS re-read guard against a
  slower/older write clobbering a newer one, best-effort — a failed read/
  write just falls back to a full recompute). `reconcileFile` is unchanged.
- `src/main.ts`: in the `status` command's `--format menubar-json` branch,
  build a query key from the resolved period/day/days range, provider,
  project/exclude filters, optimize/timeline flags, and Claude config source;
  check the snapshot before calling `buildMenubarPayloadForRange`, and save
  after a real (non-deferred) compute. The `--scope combined` device-pull
  enrichment stays live (uncached) on every call — it is not the reported
  bottleneck and already has its own best-effort fallback.
- Not touched: `buildMenubarPayloadForRange` internals, `reconcileFile`, the
  `devices` command (different call site, not the reported symptom),
  `--format json`/`terminal` status output (not the menubar's polled path).

## Acceptance

- Given an unchanged on-disk session corpus and an identical query, a second
  `codeburn status --format menubar-json` call returns byte-identical output
  to the first, sourced from the snapshot (no corpus re-parse).
- Given new session activity between two calls, a call made while the change
  is still within the settle window is deferred (serves the last settled
  snapshot); a call made once the change has aged past the window reflects
  the new data. The snapshot never serves stale results indefinitely.
- `--scope combined` vs `--scope local` from the same underlying query still
  differ only in the `combined` field; `local` never gains a stray `combined`
  key from a prior `combined` call's snapshot (the snapshot never stores the
  live device-enrichment result).

## Secondary finding: dual kqueue watches on `/`

Scoping call: **out of scope for this fix, filed as a separate follow-up.**
This investigation could not confirm this as a cause of the latency (flat FD
count over an 8s observation window) and it is orthogonal to the cache
read/write path this fix touches — it would live in whichever file-watch
setup code owns the fs-watcher init (not `session-cache.ts`), and needs its
own `fs_usage`/`dtrace` reproduction under `sudo`, which wasn't available in
this session either. No code change made for it here.

## Reconciliation with the resident `serve --stdio` process

This fix originally targeted a genuine gap: a fresh CLI spawn per menubar poll
had no cross-process reuse story at all. That premise changed after this was
opened — `src/serve.ts` now keeps a resident query server warm for the
desktop app, with a request-level `outputMemo` (capped at 5 minutes, cleared
on any config-fingerprint change) validated by root filesystem watchers
(`startRootWatchers`/`classifyRootReuse`), and falls back to a fresh CLI spawn
only when that in-process path is unavailable or refuses the command.

Decision: **keep this disk snapshot**, scoped explicitly to that fallback
spawn path (and any other one-shot invocation of `status --format
menubar-json` outside the desktop app's `serve` connection), rather than drop
it. Reasoning:

- `serve`'s memo is in-process and per-server-lifetime; it buys nothing for an
  actual CLI spawn, which is a brand-new process with no memo to hit. The
  disk snapshot is the only thing standing between that spawn and paying the
  full parse+aggregation cost — exactly the case `serve.ts`'s own module
  comment documents as the fallback it exists to catch.
- The concern that motivated re-examining this at all — "a second, weaker
  cache whose invalidation rules lose to `serve`'s whenever it hits first" —
  is addressed by the five correctness fixes in this revision (pricing-config
  hash parity with `parser.ts`'s `cacheKey`, a synthetic fingerprint for
  network providers, generic directory-shaped-source expansion, gating the
  save on `isSessionHydrationComplete()`, and anchoring the settle-window
  defer on wall-clock first-mismatch time instead of the corpus-wide newest
  mtime). With those fixed, the snapshot's own freshness check
  (`computeCorpusFingerprint`, an eager stat sweep over every discovered
  source on every call) is not weaker than `serve`'s watcher-based heuristic
  — if anything it is strictly more precise, since it re-runs discovery and
  re-stats rather than trusting `fs.watch` coverage that has documented blind
  spots (a root created after the watcher armed, a missed FSEvents
  coalescence). `serve`'s 5-minute hard cap exists as defense-in-depth
  against exactly those watcher blind spots; the disk snapshot doesn't need
  an equivalent hard cap because it isn't exposed to that failure mode in the
  first place.
- No commits upstream of this branch's merge base touch the status-snapshot
  code path (`loadStatusSnapshot`/`saveStatusSnapshot`/`statusSnapshotSettleMs`
  in `src/session-cache.ts`, or the `status --format menubar-json` handler in
  `src/main.ts`) — the two upstream cache commits in that range
  (`fix(cache): stop republishing month shards a scoped run never read`,
  `cache: CODEBURN_CACHE_SCOPE=all forces a full shard read`) are both scoped
  to `saveCache`/`loadCache`'s month-shard mechanics, a different layer of
  `session-cache.ts` entirely. No further rebase-driven reconciliation is
  needed beyond the fixes above.
