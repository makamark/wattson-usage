## @deepseek-ai/dsh-session-persistence-jsonl

`scanZstdFrames` in `src/providers/dsh.ts` is a transcription of the function of
the same name in this package (`src/zstd.ts`), which is what lets CodeBurn read
a DeepSeek Harness session log without depending on the harness itself. No other
part of the package is used.

Upstream declares two different licenses for this package: the published npm
package (0.0.1-rc.1) ships a BSD 3-Clause `LICENSE` and declares
`"license": "BSD-3-Clause"`, while the monorepo source it is built from
(`deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`, `packages/session/session-persistence-jsonl`)
declares MIT. The stricter of the two is reproduced below.

## Provider identification vectors

The Capacity Dock bundles selected provider SVGs from an MIT-licensed vector
collection at source revision
`714bff00815f0d98ae206e781d563595129ba185`. CodeBurn vendors these as static
resources and does not link to or ship that collection's application runtime.
The applicable notice follows.

The JetBrains and Notion vectors come from Simple Icons under CC0 1.0. CC0
waives copyright and related rights to the extent permitted by law, but does
not grant trademark rights; the identification-only statement below applies.

## CodexBar

The Capacity Dock's provider usage tracking — the set of provider endpoints and response shapes CodeBurn reads to show per-provider quota — was informed by CodexBar (https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar) by Peter Steinberger, an MIT-licensed macOS menubar app for tracking AI provider usage. CodeBurn's adapters are an independent implementation written for the Capacity Dock; CodexBar is credited here as prior art for the approach.
