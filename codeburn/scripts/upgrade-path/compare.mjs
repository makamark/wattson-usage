// Per-provider payload parity between the published CLI and this build.
//
//   node scripts/upgrade-path/compare.mjs <baselineDir> <upgradedDir>
//
// Each dir holds the payloads run.mjs captured: `export.json` (per-call records,
// the token/call source) and `menubar.json` (the unrounded per-provider cost).
// Prints one row per provider and exits non-zero on a diff that is not expected.
//
// Expectations, and why:
//   claude, codex, gemini, kiro, cursor  parse identically either side of the
//       upgrade. Calls and every token field must match EXACTLY; cost is allowed
//       COST_TOLERANCE of drift because the two binaries carry different bundled
//       LiteLLM price snapshots and only agree when the shared pricing cache in
//       CODEBURN_CACHE_DIR is warm (which it is, unless the runner is offline).
//   grok    changed by design in #1015: usage now comes from the CLI's own
//       turn_completed records instead of a context-curve estimate. The change
//       is REPORTED, never asserted — not even directionally. On real corpora
//       the changelog documents totals rising, but that is a property of real
//       Grok sessions, and the direction here would only reflect how the
//       generator happened to size its synthetic context curve against its
//       synthetic usage records. Both sides must still count the same SESSIONS,
//       which is the part the corpus can honestly establish.
//   dsh     did not exist in the published CLI. Reported; required to be absent
//       in the baseline and present after the upgrade.
//   codex   PRICING changed by design in #1075: reasoning tokens are billed
//       inside output rather than on top of it, and cache writes are carved out
//       of the input bucket. Nothing about what was PARSED moved, so codex keeps
//       the full exact treatment for the call count and every token field; the
//       cost tolerance is instead replaced with REPRICE_TOLERANCE — the
//       upgraded cost must be strictly lower than the baseline and within 25%
//       of it, since #1075 only ever removes a double-count and never raises
//       cost — and the delta is reported instead. Drop it from this list once a
//       published CLI carries the fix.
