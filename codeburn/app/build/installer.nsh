; Uninstalling CodeBurn Desktop removes the tray app only when this app is what
; put it there. src/menubar-installer.ts writes the marker at install time and
; credits whoever got there first, so a tray app someone installed by hand with
; `codeburn menubar` survives, and the one the desktop app installed goes with it.
;
; PowerShell does the reading: the marker is JSON, and the product code lives
; inside the uninstall string Windows Installer wrote. `$$` is a literal dollar
; for NSIS, so every `$$` below is a PowerShell variable, and every string inside
; the command is single-quoted. NSIS has no doubled-quote escape: a `''` inside a
; single-quoted NSIS string ends it, and the plugin then received a truncated
; command that PowerShell could not parse, so the hook silently did nothing. Each
; inner quote is therefore written as `$\'`, the NSIS escape for a literal quote.

  ; An upgrade runs the previous version's uninstaller first, with --updated, and
