// The tray app and the Capacity Dock, as the desktop app owns them on Windows.
//
// The desktop app ships the matching `windows-v*` build of the Tauri tray app
// (windows/) and puts it on the machine itself, so nobody has to know that
// `codeburn menubar` exists. Two switches in the sidebar turn each surface off:
// "Menu bar" is the tray process, "Sidebar" is the dock rail the tray app
// draws. Both default on.
//
// Two routes, and they share almost nothing:
//
//   NSIS   the staged `CodeBurn.Menubar_<version>_x64_en-US.msi` is installed
//          through the CLI's own installer (src/menubar-installer.ts, reached
//          with `codeburn menubar --staged-msi <path>`). The MSI carries a fixed
//          WiX upgrade code, so a manual `codeburn menubar` install is upgraded
//          in place rather than duplicated, and a newer one is left alone.
//          Launch at login is an HKCU Run value.
//
//   AppX   msiexec is not available to a packaged app and would fight the
//          package manager anyway. The tray exe ships inside the package and
//          is launched from there; launch at login is the manifest's
//          windows.startupTask, so no Run value is written.
//
// The tray app is reached through its own argv: a second launch hands the
// running instance its arguments (windows/src-tauri/src/lib.rs), so `--quit`
// stops it and `--reload-settings` makes it re-read the dock preferences this
// module writes.
