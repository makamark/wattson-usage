//
//   ~/.config/codeburn/windows-settings.json   everything only the tray app cares about
//   ~/.config/codeburn/windows-dock.json       the Capacity Dock, whose placement lives here too
//
// Both hold keys this side has no business touching (the rail's placement, the tray app's
// theme cache), so every write is a merge of the named keys into whatever is already there.
// And every value is checked against the same closed set the tray app parses it with
// (windows/src/lib/appSettings.ts, windows/src/lib/dockPrefs.ts): a value it cannot
// understand collapses to a default there, so sending one would silently lose the setting.
//
// After a write the tray app is nudged with `--reload-settings`, which makes it re-read both
// files and broadcast to its own windows. That is done by the caller, which owns the process.

// into whatever the other last stored. The atomic rename each already does stops a torn file,
// but not a lost update: two writers read the same state, change different keys, and the later
// rename erases the earlier writer's key, so a dock placement, an enabled switch, a provider
// choice or a scale silently reverts. This lock serializes the whole cycle so that never
// happens. The tray app runs the same protocol from Rust; the single write-up lives in
// windows/src-tauri/src/settings.rs (`prefs_lock`). The essentials, so both sides stay in step:
//
//   Lock file:  sibling of the target named `.<stem>.lock` (windows-dock.json ->
//               `.windows-dock.lock`).
//   Body:       one line of JSON, `{"pid":<os pid>,"at":<unix ms>}`.
//   Acquire:    exclusive create ('wx'). On success keep the handle open for the whole cycle.
//               On collision take the lock over only if abandoned, else poll until a short wait
//               budget runs out and then throw rather than write behind the holder.
//   Abandoned:  its mtime is older than the stale window (a crashed holder never refreshes it),
//               OR its recorded pid is not ours and no longer alive. A live holder is neither.
//   Takeover:   removing an abandoned lock is itself arbitrated, by an exclusive create of
//               `<lock>.takeover`. Only its winner may unlink the lock, and only after
//               re-checking that the lock is still abandoned. See `reclaimAbandoned`.
