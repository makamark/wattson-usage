// Behavioral weight — the single definition of which served calls count as

// paired with its per-turn call (`supplementaryAccounting`, assigned at serve
// time) carries real tokens and cost but is not a distinct behavioral
// request. Hermes observation-time deltas persist the same flag. Every
// user-visible calls/turns counter weighs calls through these helpers so no
// surface can disagree with the session summaries or the sealed daily
// history. Token and cost sums intentionally keep every call —
// supplementary accounting must never be filtered out, only weightless.
